lexical-sickness
================

I have a serious sickness, I need to have everything sorted by lexicographic order when it's possible.

Of course I know that sometimes is better sort source code by functional criteria but I've found useful sort methods lexicographic in some legacy code that I'd had to work

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lexical-sickness'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lexical-sickness

## Usage

$> lexical-sickness <action> [options]
    -f, --file File                  File to cure
    -m, --models                     Cure all files under app/models dir
    -v, --version                    Show the current version of this gem

    -h, --help                       Show this help message.
