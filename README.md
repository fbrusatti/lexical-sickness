lexical-sickness
================

I have a serious sickness, I need to have everything sorted by lexicographic order when it's possible.

Of course I know that sometimes is better sort source code by functional criteria but I've found useful sort methods lexicographic in some legacy code that I'd had to work

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lexical-sickness'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lexical-sickness

## Usage

$> lex-sort <file>

## Contributing

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
